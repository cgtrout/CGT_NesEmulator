Basic NES emulator project - a learning project not designed to be feature competitive with other emulators.  Written for C++ for Windows.

Much of the code was written several years ago, and does not conform to the latest C++ standards in all cases.  However, recently I have spent some time updating the project to be more conformant in several areas.

The goal for this project was simply to learn how to build an emulator and to get it to run several games for the NES.  I succeeded in this goal, as it runs several games such as:

* Super Mario Bros
* Ice Hockey
* Contra
* Megaman

Features a full hex viewer and step debugger:

It has limited support for all the "mappers" available, so many games will not even load.  The sound is partially implemented and has some issues in its current state.
