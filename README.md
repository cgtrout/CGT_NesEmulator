# CGT_NesEmulator
Basic NES emulator project - a learning project not designed to be feature competitive with other emulators.  Written for C++ for Windows.

Note that this was written before I had a modern understanding of C++ memory management so it does not conform to the latest C++ standards.  Also as a result, it does not compile on the lastest versions of the MSVC compilers.

The goal for this project was to learn how to build an emulator and to get it to run several games for the NES.  I succeeded in this goal, as it runs several games such as:

* Super Mario Bros
* Ice Hockey
* Contra
* Megaman
